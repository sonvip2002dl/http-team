The Keysight U3810A is an IoT Educational Kit.  There are many concepts that
can be explored with this system. One concept is digital signing where an
addition signature is added while generating the Hash Summary.  The original
document and the Hash summary are sent.  At no point does the signature get
passed over the network. This is a way to authenticate documents and data,
that they came from an authentic source.
